# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

To start, you'll need to create an App on MongoDB Atlas(under app services)
After that, create an .env file and add the id of your app on a PUBLIC_APP_ID variable. Example below:

```javascript
PUBLIC_APP_ID=your_app
```
